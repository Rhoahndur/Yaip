## Notes

### What's Going Well
- ‚úÖ MVP implementation completed quickly (~1 day)
- ‚úÖ No major blockers encountered
- ‚úÖ SwiftUI + Firebase integration smooth
- ‚úÖ Real-time features working as expected
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture easy to extend

### What Needs Attention
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication login flow needs thorough testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to create Firestore composite index
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to acquire AI API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Pinecone)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need Apple Developer account for push notifications (later)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need multi-user testing

### Lessons Learned
1. **@DocumentID handling**: Setting `id: nil` when creating documents is crucial
2. **Swift Concurrency**: Proper use of `@MainActor` and `nonisolated` prevents warnings
3. **Firestore Indexes**: Complex queries require composite indexes in Firebase Console
4. **SwiftData Integration**: Works seamlessly with Firestore for offline support
5. **Optimistic UI**: Improves perceived performance dramatically
6. **Error Handling**: Fallback logic and logging essential for debugging
7. **Real-time Listeners**: Must be cleaned up properly in `deinit` or `onDisappear`
8. **State Ownership** (NEW): Clear rules for local vs. network state prevent race conditions
9. **Centralized Managers** (NEW): Singleton managers (ImageUploadManager, NetworkMonitor) reduce complexity
10. **View Modifiers** (NEW): Custom SwiftUI modifiers provide declarative, reusable patterns
11. **Image Caching** (NEW): Cache to disk, cleanup after upload, max 3 retries
12. **@StateObject vs @ObservedObject** (NEW): Use @ObservedObject for shared singletons to observe changes correctly
13. **Fire-and-Forget Tasks** (NEW): Wrap Firestore updates in `Task { }` to prevent UI hangs when offline
14. **Pending Conversations** (NEW): Don't create Firestore conversations until first message to avoid blank chats
15. **Type Inference** (NEW): Explicit loops sometimes needed instead of `Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:)` for complex types
