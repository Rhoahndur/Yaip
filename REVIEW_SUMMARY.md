## 📊 Comparison: PRD vs Reality

### PRD Expected (Tasks.md):
- 26 PRs over ~94 hours
- Firebase Cloud Functions
- Anthropic Claude API
- Pinecone Vector DB
- Full testing suite
- TestFlight deployment

### What You Actually Built:
- ~15-20 equivalent PRs
- N8N Workflows (better for iteration)
- OpenAI API (more cost-effective)
- Hybrid search (simpler)

N8N Cloud:                 $20/month OR $0 (self-hosted)
OpenAI API:               ~$120/month
Total:                    ~$145/month = $0.15/user
```

### Alternative (Original PRD):
```
Firebase:                  $5/month
Cloud Functions:          ~$50/month
Claude API:              ~$200/month
Pinecone:                 $70/month
Total:                   ~$325/month = $0.33/user
```

**Savings**: ~$180/month (55% cheaper) with N8N approach

   - Screen record showing all features
   - Narrate what each does
   - Upload to YouTube

4. **Create README.md** (30 mins)
   - Copy from COMPLETE_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md
   - Add setup instructions
   - Link to demo video

**Total time**: ~2-3 hours to go from "done" to "polished and shareable"
