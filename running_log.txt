# Running Log - Yaip Project Setup Session
Date: October 21, 2025

Initial Web Claude Prompts:

so have this new project in mind can you make a PRD document for a possible implementation, for the tech stack I'd like to implement in Swift and also use Firebase for the backend, please let me know if there are any questions:


can you make sure to focus the PRD on the MVP deliverables first.  In terms of your questions, 1) For personal choice yes lets go with Remote Team Professional.  2) Lets go with Option B 3) Lets try contextual AI features embedded in conversations. 4)Yes planning to follow the full week sprint, but dont worry about the timeline lets just make sure we cover everything actionable especially the MVP since thats first to accomplish. 5) I'll be building this solo

take this document you generated create for me a task list. This task list should be a checklist of all the tasks that need to be done, broken down by PRs. Every time a PR is completed, I'm going to be sending that up using Git to my GitHub repository and tracking the progression of this codebase. So in this task list, there should be high-level PR-related tasks, and then each of the subtasks for each of the PRs to be completed. Identify the file structure that is going to be associated with this project, and then let me know within each of the tasks what files I'm updating and what files I may be editing.

So now that we've done the task list and the PRD, use this context to create a mermaid diagram. A mermaid diagram that describes the connections between my entire codebase, the client-server interactions, and any other technologies that I'm going to be using.

### Prompt 16:
can you initialize memory bank for this new project/workspace

### Prompt 17:
Great, so now in reference to the PRD and architecture .md files lets go through each of the tasks in Tasks.md and build the MVP version of the mobile messanging app. and please let me know at each task if you need any clarifications or there are design options to consider as well as when I need to setup something up

### Prompt 18:
im using Bundle Identifier Tavern.Yaip   and yes I've setup a firebase account already do you need any information about the firebase account?

### Prompt 19:
app name is now Yaip, and bundle ID is yaip.tavern.  It's not MessageAI anymore - can you please update wherever necessary? Oh shoot I forgot leave Create Git Repository unchecked for the XCode proejct creation. And I set minimum deployment to iOS 17.6. Project test built successfully, I did have to remove Push Notifications for now though / doesnt seem like I can add it while I'm simulating devices (which is what I want to stick to for now)

### Prompt 20:

### Prompt 28:
im unable to login says in app "Login failed. Please try again" in XCode console seeing nw_socket_set_connection_idle [C7.1.1.1:3] setsockopt SO_CONNECTION_IDLE failed [42: Protocol not available] nw_socket_set_connection_idle [C7.1.1.1:3] setsockopt SO_CONNECTION_IDLE failed [42: Protocol not available] nw_socket_set_connection_idle [C8.1.1.1:3] setsockopt SO_CONNECTION_IDLE failed [42: Protocol not available] nw_socket_set_connection_idle [C8.1.1.1:3] setsockopt SO_CONNECTION_IDLE failed [42: Protocol not available] ❌ Error fetching user profile: The operation couldn't be completed.

I dont remember the password anyways)

### Prompt 29:
getting the (image attached) message when trying to sign in in the app (I deleted the entries in firebase to try to 'restart' because forgot my password and the reset feature doesn't work) and heres whats XCode console saying: [console output with haptic pattern errors and input operation errors]

### Prompt 30:
immedieatly after command+R i see this in the console: 12.4.0 - [GoogleUtilities/AppDelegateSwizzler][I-SWZ001014] App Delegate does not conform to UIApplicationDelegate protocol. nw_endpoint_flow_failed_with_error [C1 2607:f8b0:4006:806::200a.443 failed parent-flow (unsatisfied (No network route))] already failing, returning nw_connection_get_connected_socket_block_invoke [C1] Client called nw_connection_get_connected_socket on unconnected nw_connection TCP Conn 0x60000330cd20 Failed : error 0:50 [50] Error: User document not found

### Prompt 31:
I am able to select a user and I guess look at our chat (which is just blank) and theres no way I can type stuff or anything. But I digress, are you going to do the next PR or where are we at?

### Prompt 32:
im unable to login says in app "Login failed.

### Prompt 34:
actually how about we finish building the whole MVP and then we can trouble shoot? Please proceeed with the next PR

### Prompt 35:

### Prompt 36:
right now every user it just says User

### Prompt 37:

### Prompt 41:
seeing a few errors when app initializes on iphone in simulator: Decoding error: decodingIsNotSupported("Could not find DocumentReference for user info key: CodingUserInfoKey(rawValue: \"DocumentRefUserInfoKey\").\nDocumentID values can only be decoded with Firestore.Decoder") ❌ Data causing error: ["displayName": Alice, "lastSeen": <FIRTimestamp: seconds=1761005986 nanoseconds=181233000>, "createdAt": <FIRTimestamp: seconds=1761005986 nanoseconds=181233000>, "status": online, "email": alice@test.com] 12.4.0 - [FirebaseFirestore][I-FST000002] Attempting to initialize or set a @DocumentID property with a non-nil value: "CCXnppvrkiXSbnslca0LGJyKBdi2". The document ID is managed by Firestore and any initialized or set value will be ignored. The ID is automatically set when reading from Firestore. ✅ Used fallback user construction Error loading user status: decodingIsNotSupported("Could not find DocumentReference for user info key: CodingUserInfoKey(rawValue: \"DocumentRefUserInfoKey\").\nDocumentID values can only be decoded with Firestore.Decoder")

### Prompt 42:
on starting up on iphone simulator seeing these messages: nw_endpoint_flow_failed_with_error [C1 2607:f8b0:4006:801::200a.443 failed parent-flow (unsatisfied (No network route))] already failing, returning

TCP Conn 0x6000033094a0 Failed : error 0:50 [50]

### Prompt 43:
the "Read" messages doesn't seem to update fully though or it seems if I sign in and out it'll update

### Prompt 44:
how can we enable group chat as a feature?

### Prompt 45:
how can we get Push Notifications working in foreground

### Prompt 46:
ah i wish you hadnt done that - I cannot enable Push Notifications in Xcode, could we do local notifications + in-app banners with a websocket to simulate a push. UX could function the same?

### Prompt 47:
got some some errors on building - two in LocalNotificationsManager and 3 in InAppBannerView (missing Combine imports and optional String unwrapping)

### Prompt 48:
can you add this file to gitignore and remove it from repo (its been committed) @https://github.com/Rhoahndur/Yaip/blob/869c8157ee9bc982f807ab85168d27f2c6c0b457/Yaip/Yaip/GoogleService-Info.plist

### Prompt 49:
Lets go with option A (BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove GoogleService-Info.plist from Git history)

### Prompt 50:
so when i sign out of app the other user still sees me as online

### Prompt 51:
ok uhh so I signed in as a user and it seems like I can see a chat for myself?

### Prompt 52:
how does the sign in "remembering" work?

### Prompt 53:
can we have when user signs in to indicate who's the signed in user vs who you're talking to? Also the notifications is weird i think its being broadcast to everyone instead of just to the user the message is addressed to.

### Prompt 54:
also can you make the interface look closer to this design? (Signal messenger design)

### Prompt 55:
why does it say Bob for each of the users chats even though its same chat (but from different users perspectives)? also can the which user is signed into the app be nice and tight at the top instead of like it is now?

### Prompt 56:
No symbol named 'checkmark.checkmark' found in system symbol set

### Prompt 57:
the push notifications is still glitchy - sometimes itll push a bunch of notifications through sometimes just the last one sometimes to the intended reciepient sometimes to both. Also I can select users to add to a Group Chat but I can't actually create a group chat

### Prompt 58:
still cannot create group chat actually the Create button looks greyed out??, and also getting this error rror loading user: Error Domain=UserService Code=404 "User not found" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=User not found}

### Prompt 59:
getting these messages in xcode console when i try to click Create when Im trying to setup a group chat (excessive logging and user not found errors)

### Prompt 60:
oh can you make that clearer somehow may be a hint if user doesnt get it right away?  Create then shouldn't have the 'click' animation if something else is expected

### Prompt 61:
hmm there seems to be two types of push notifications - one for when youre in-app and im guessing one where youre not actively in the app - Im seeing both notifications happen while Im in the app

### Prompt 62:
when i have the app minimized I dont see any push notifications

### Prompt 63:
also for every message that hasnt been read can the red counter notification increment up? I mean when the app is minimized, maybe up to 9 or so or just have like * instead otherwise 1 can be misleading since there could be many unread messages.  Also how are we handling if the phone is offline and then pushing messages that were meant to be sent out from the phone & syncing up to whatever messages have been sent to the phone but not recieved

### Prompt 64:
not seeing any notifications when the app is minimized even though permission was allowed

### Prompt 65:
also the one time there shouldnt be notifications is if user is actively in the chat where a new message is coming from - thats redundant

### Prompt 66:
can you add for the group chat you can click on messages and see who read them or not?  Also for just general mechanic of message read - if both users are in same message thread - and someone messages, it doesn't (lets say within 1-2 seconds update to "Read", you actually have to leave the chat and come back into it to register) can we adjust this

### Prompt 67:
build failing: /Users/aleksandrgaun/Downloads/Yaip/Yaip/Yaip/Views/Chat/GroupMessageBubble.swift:129:27 Missing arguments for parameters 'conversation', 'currentUserID' in call , also /Users/aleksandrgaun/Downloads/Yaip/Yaip/Yaip/Views/Chat/MessageReadReceiptsView.swift:131:13 Argument 'mediaURL' must precede argument 'timestamp'

### Prompt 68:
build failed: /Users/aleksandrgaun/Downloads/Yaip/Yaip/Yaip/Views/Chat/GroupMessageBubble.swift:138:17 Argument 'mediaURL' must precede argument 'timestamp' and this error also /Users/aleksandrgaun/Downloads/Yaip/Yaip/Yaip/Views/Chat/MessageReadReceiptsView.swift:131:13 Argument 'mediaURL' must precede argument 'timestamp'

### Prompt 69:
ChatViewModel error while building: /Users/aleksandrgaun/Downloads/Yaip/Yaip/Yaip/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift:105:59 Trailing closure passed to parameter of type 'Predicate<Message>' that does not accept a closure

### Prompt 70:
in chat view model another error for Build: /Users/aleksandrgaun/Downloads/Yaip/Yaip/Yaip/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift:100:41 Value of type 'ChatViewModel' has no member 'currentUserID'

### Prompt 71:
how frequently is "being online" being checked?

### Prompt 72:
Yeah lets go with option A for now

### Prompt 73:
if user signs out that should show up as "offline" for others, and if they just minimize the app it should be set to "away"

### Prompt 74:
we cool with these messages in xcode console im seeing when re-deploying re-built app to simulator? Decoding error: valueNotFound(Foundation.Date, Swift.DecodingError.Context(codingPath: [CodingKeys(stringValue: "lastSeen", intValue: nil)], debugDescription: "Expected Date value but found null instead.", underlyingError: nil))
✅ Used fallback user construction
12.4.0 - [FirebaseFirestore][I-FST000002] Attempting to initialize or set a @DocumentID property with a non-nil value: "CCXnppvrkiXSbnslca0LGJyKBdi2". The document ID is managed by Firestore and any initialized or set value will be ignored. The ID is automatically set when reading from Firestore.

### Prompt 75:
can you refactor all these .md files besides PRD, Tasks and architecture into a docs directory bucketed into FEATURES, SETUP and TECHNICAL .md files?

### Prompt 76:
can the push notifications when clicked to take you to the chat the notification is from?

### Prompt 77:
also while i have the app minimized, ie in main phone view im still not seeing push notifications that are relevant to me even though in permissions i allowed notifications

### Prompt 78:
ah gotcha OK yeah lets stick with current setup for now since for MVP this'll do
