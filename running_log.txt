# Running Log - Yaip Project Setup Session
Date: October 21, 2025

Initial Web Claude Prompts:

so have this new project in mind can you make a PRD document for a possible implementation, for the tech stack I'd like to implement in Swift and also use Firebase for the backend, please let me know if there are any questions:


can you make sure to focus the PRD on the MVP deliverables first.  In terms of your questions, 1) For personal choice yes lets go with Remote Team Professional.  2) Lets go with Option B 3) Lets try contextual AI features embedded in conversations. 4)Yes planning to follow the full week sprint, but dont worry about the timeline lets just make sure we cover everything actionable especially the MVP since thats first to accomplish. 5) I'll be building this solo

take this document you generated create for me a task list. This task list should be a checklist of all the tasks that need to be done, broken down by PRs. Every time a PR is completed, I'm going to be sending that up using Git to my GitHub repository and tracking the progression of this codebase. So in this task list, there should be high-level PR-related tasks, and then each of the subtasks for each of the PRs to be completed. Identify the file structure that is going to be associated with this project, and then let me know within each of the tasks what files I'm updating and what files I may be editing.

So now that we've done the task list and the PRD, use this context to create a mermaid diagram. A mermaid diagram that describes the connections between my entire codebase, the client-server interactions, and any other technologies that I'm going to be using.

### Prompt 16:
can you initialize memory bank for this new project/workspace

### Prompt 17:
Great, so now in reference to the PRD and architecture .md files lets go through each of the tasks in Tasks.md and build the MVP version of the mobile messanging app. and please let me know at each task if you need any clarifications or there are design options to consider as well as when I need to setup something up

### Prompt 18:
im using Bundle Identifier Tavern.Yaip   and yes I've setup a firebase account already do you need any information about the firebase account?

### Prompt 19:
app name is now Yaip, and bundle ID is yaip.tavern.  It's not MessageAI anymore - can you please update wherever necessary? Oh shoot I forgot leave Create Git Repository unchecked for the XCode proejct creation. And I set minimum deployment to iOS 17.6. Project test built successfully, I did have to remove Push Notifications for now though / doesnt seem like I can add it while I'm simulating devices (which is what I want to stick to for now)

ah i wish you hadnt done that - I cannot enable Push Notifications in Xcode, could we do local notifications + in-app banners with a websocket to simulate a push. UX could function the same?
