```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps: Connecting N8N

### Step 1: Setup N8N Instance
You have 2 options:

**Option A: N8N Cloud** (Easy, $20/month)
```bash
1. Sign up at n8n.cloud
2. Create new workflow
3. Get webhook URL: https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/...
```

**Option B: Self-Hosted** (Free, more control)
```bash
# Docker
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n

# Access at http://localhost:5678
```

### Step 2: Create First Workflow (Thread Summarization)

In N8N:
1. Create new workflow: "Summarize Thread"
2. Add nodes:

```
[Webhook Node]
  - Method: POST
  - Path: /summarize
  - Authentication: Header Auth (Bearer token)

‚Üì

[Firestore Node] - Get Messages
  - Credentials: Firebase Admin SDK
  - Collection: conversations/{{$json.conversationID}}/messages
  - Operation: Get many
  - Return all: True
  - Limit: {{$json.parameters.messageCount}}
  - Sort: timestamp ASC

‚Üì

[Function Node] - Format for Claude
  - JavaScript code:
    const messages = $input.all().map(item => ({
      sender: item.json.senderID,
      text: item.json.text,
      timestamp: item.json.timestamp
    }));
    return [{json: {messages}}];

‚Üì

[HTTP Request Node] - Call Claude API
  - Method: POST
  - URL: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
  - Authentication: Header Auth (x-api-key)
  - Headers:
    - anthropic-version: 2023-06-01
    - content-type: application/json
  - Body:
    {
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
      "max_tokens": 1024,
      "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Analyze this conversation and provide a summary..."
      }]
    }

‚Üì

[Firestore Node] - Cache Result
  - Operation: Set
  - Collection: aiCache
  - Document ID: summary_{{$json.conversationID}}_{{$now}}

‚Üì

[Respond to Webhook]
  - Body:
    {
      "success": true,
      "summary": {{$json.content[0].text}},
      "messageCount": {{$json.messageCount}},
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "timestamp": "{{$now}}"
    }
```

### Step 3: Update iOS App

In `Services/N8NService.swift`:
```swift
// Change this line:
private let baseURL = "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook"

// To your actual N8N webhook URL:
private let baseURL = "https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud/webhook"
```

### Step 4: Replace Mock with Real Call

In `N8NService.swift`, replace:
```swift
// OLD (Mock):
return try await mockSummarizeThread(conversationID: conversationID, messageCount: messageCount)

// NEW (Real):
let response: AIResponse<ThreadSummary> = try await callWebhook(
    request: request,
    responseType: AIResponse<ThreadSummary>.self
)
return response.data
```

### Step 5: Test End-to-End
1. Open chat in app
2. Tap sparkles ‚ú® ‚Üí "Summarize Thread"
3. Watch network request in Xcode console
4. See real AI-generated summary!

## üìä What Each AI Feature Does

### 1. Thread Summarization
**When to use**: Long conversation (50+ messages), returning after vacation, need quick context

**What it extracts**:
- Key discussion points (bullets)
- Decisions made (‚úÖ checkmarks)
- Action items assigned (üéØ targets)
- Open questions (‚ùì marks)
- Overall tone (urgent, collaborative, blocked, etc.)

**Mock data**: Realistic Q4 planning discussion summary

---

### 2. Action Item Extraction
**When to use**: After meetings, end of week review, delegation

**What it detects**:
- Explicit tasks: "I'll deploy to production"
- Assigned tasks: "Can you review the PR?"
- Deadlines: "Need this by Friday" (extracts date)
- Priority: Based on language (urgent, critical, ASAP = high)
- Context: Surrounding discussion

**Mock data**: 3 realistic tasks with assignees, deadlines, priorities

---

### 3. Meeting Suggestions
**When to use**: Scheduling discussions ("Let's meet", "Find time", "Schedule call")

**What it does**:
- Detects scheduling intent
- Analyzes context (what's the meeting about)
- (Future) Checks calendars
- Suggests 3 optimal times
- Shows availability/conflicts
- Lists participants

**Mock data**: 3 time slots for Q4 planning meeting

---

### 4. Decision Tracking
**When to use**: After big discussions, architecture decisions, policy changes

**What it captures**:
- Decision made ("We're going with PostgreSQL")
- Reasoning ("Better fit for relational data")
- Alternatives considered ("MongoDB was option B")
- Participants in discussion
- Timestamp

**Mock data**: 2 engineering decisions (architecture, hiring)

---

### 5. Priority Detection
**When to use**: Daily inbox review, urgent situations

**What it scores (0-10)**:
- 9-10: Direct @mention + urgent keywords
- 7-8: Questions/tasks directed at you
- 4-6: General updates you're involved in
- 0-3: FYI, social messages

**Mock data**: 2 high-priority messages with reasons

---

### 6. Smart Search
**When to use**: Finding past discussions by meaning, not keywords

**How it works**:
- **Semantic**: "budget discussion" finds all budget talks
- **Keyword**: Exact match fallback
- **Hybrid**: Combines both approaches
- Relevance scoring (0-1)

**Mock data**: 2 search results about Q4 budget

## üí° AI Agent Ideas Summary

From the comprehensive `AI_AGENT_IDEAS.md` document, here are the 8 AI agent types I designed for remote teams:

1. **Triage Agent** - Reduces noise, scores priority
2. **Context Agent** - Knowledge management, smart summaries
3. **Coordination Agent** - Scheduling, reminders, timezone handling
4. **Memory Agent** - Decision tracking, project timeline
5. **Action Agent** - Task extraction, automatic tracking
6. **Onboarding Agent** - Helps new members catch up
7. **Writing Agent** - Composition help, tone adjustment
8. **Analytics Agent** - Team health insights, patterns

**Key insights for remote teams**:
- Context switching kills productivity ‚Üí AI reduces it
- Important info gets buried ‚Üí AI surfaces it
- Scheduling across timezones is painful ‚Üí AI handles it
- Decisions get lost in threads ‚Üí AI preserves them
- Tasks fall through cracks ‚Üí AI tracks them
