# Typing Indicator Guide

## What Was Enhanced

### Visual Improvements ✅
- Changed from subtle text + dots to **iMessage-style bubble**
- Larger animated dots (8px instead of 4px)
- Gray bubble background for prominence
- Smoother animations with opacity changes
- More visible in the UI

## How Typing Indicators Work

### Technical Flow:
1. **User A starts typing** → TextField text changes
2. **ChatViewModel detects change** → Debounced (300ms)
3. **Updates Firestore** → `conversations/{id}/presence/{userID}` with `isTyping: true`
4. **User B's listener** → Receives the update
5. **User B sees indicator** → Animated bubble with 3 dots appears
6. **Auto-stops after 3 seconds** of no typing changes

### Limitations:
- **Only works in 1-on-1 chats** (not group chats in current implementation)
- **Requires 2 different users** on different devices/simulators
- **Needs proper Firebase Security Rules** to allow presence subcollection writes

## Testing Requirements

### ✅ What You Need:
1. **Two separate test accounts**
   - Account 1: alice@test.com (Simulator 1)
   - Account 2: bob@test.com (Simulator 2)

2. **Two simulators running simultaneously**
   - Xcode → Window → Devices and Simulators
   - Boot two iPhone simulators
   - Run app on both (select target in Xcode)

3. **A 1-on-1 conversation between them**
   - From Alice's device, create chat with Bob
   - Keep chat open on both devices

### 🧪 How to Test:

**Setup:**
1. Open Simulator 1 (Alice logged in)
2. Open Simulator 2 (Bob logged in)  
3. Alice creates a chat with Bob
4. Bob opens the conversation
5. Position simulators side-by-side on screen

**Test Typing:**
1. **On Alice's device**: Start typing in the text field
2. **On Bob's device**: You should see the typing bubble appear
3. **Wait 3 seconds** without typing → Bubble disappears
4. **Continue typing** → Bubble reappears

## Firebase Security Rules

The typing indicator writes to: `conversations/{conversationId}/presence/{userId}`

### Required Rule:
```javascript
match /conversations/{conversationId}/presence/{userId} {
  allow read: if isParticipant(conversationId);
  allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId && isParticipant(conversationId);
}

function isParticipant(conversationId) {
  return request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/conversations/$(conversationId)).data.participants;
}
```

### Check Your Rules:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
2. Make sure presence subcollection writes are allowed
3. Deploy rules if you made changes

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the typing indicator"

**Check 1: Are you using 2 different accounts?**
- ❌ Can't test on same account
- ✅ Must be Alice & Bob on separate devices

**Check 2: Is it a 1-on-1 conversation?**
- ❌ Group chats don't show typing indicators (not implemented)
- ✅ Direct messages only

**Check 3: Is the other person actually typing?**
- Type at least 1 character in the text field
- Wait 300ms for debounce
- Watch the other device

**Check 4: Check Firebase Console**
- Go to Firestore Database
- Navigate to: `conversations/{your-conv-id}/presence/`
- You should see documents being created/updated when typing
- If not, check Security Rules

**Check 5: Check Xcode Console**
- Look for errors like "Permission denied"
- This means Security Rules need updating

### "The indicator appears but doesn't animate"

This shouldn't happen with the new code, but if it does:
- Make sure you're on iOS 17.6+
- Try restarting the simulator
- Check that `animating` state is being set in `onAppear`

### "The indicator doesn't disappear"

The indicator should auto-hide after:
- User sends the message
- 3 seconds of no typing changes

If it's stuck, it might be a listener issue:
- Check that `stopListening()` is being called
- Verify the typing timer is invalidating properly

## What's Not Implemented (Future Enhancements)

### Group Chat Typing Indicators
Currently not implemented. Would show:
- "Alice is typing..."
- "Alice and Bob are typing..."
- "Alice and 2 others are typing..."

### Multiple Typing Users in 1-on-1
Edge case: If someone has multiple devices, we could show that.

### Typing Indicator in Conversation List
Could show small dots next to conversation if someone is typing.

## Visual Preview

**What You'll See:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐

```

The bubble appears on the left side (like received messages) with 3 animated gray dots.

## Summary

✅ **Typing indicator is now implemented and enhanced**
✅ **Visual appearance improved (iMessage-style bubble)**
✅ **Works for 1-on-1 conversations**
✅ **Auto-hides after 3 seconds or when message sent**

🧪 **To test: Use 2 simulators with different accounts**

**Status**: Fully implemented with enhanced visuals 🎉
